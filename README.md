# FlowState  
## End-to-End Software Development Workflow Automation Platform

FlowState is a modular, event-driven orchestration platform designed to automate complex software development workflows across disconnected tools. It uses a decoupled adapter-based architecture to integrate multiple systems and ensure seamless workflow execution throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Description

FlowState is a web-based system that automates the complete software development workflow — from feature request submission to development, testing, and deployment. It coordinates tasks, enforces process rules, and provides visibility across all stages of the SDLC.

The platform reduces manual coordination between teams, improves task tracking, and ensures consistent execution of development processes using predefined automation rules and role-based access control.

## What FlowState Solves

Modern development workflows often involve multiple tools and manual handoffs, leading to:

- Delays in process execution  
- Lack of visibility into progress  
- Human errors in task coordination  
- Difficulty maintaining consistent workflows  

FlowState addresses these challenges by centralizing workflow orchestration and automating transitions between stages.

## Key Capabilities

- End-to-end workflow orchestration across SDLC stages  
- Event-driven process automation  
- Integration with external tools via adapter architecture  
- Rule-based task routing and decision logic  
- Role-based access control  
- Real-time process tracking and monitoring  
- Audit logging for traceability

## How It Works

1. A workflow is defined representing a software development process.
2. Events (e.g., feature request, code push, test result) trigger workflow actions.
3. Automation rules determine the next steps.
4. Tasks are routed to the appropriate users or systems.
5. Each stage is tracked and logged for visibility and auditing.

## Goal of the Platform

The goal of FlowState is to provide a flexible and scalable system that can automate and orchestrate complex development workflows without requiring manual coordination or custom integration for every tool.

## Project Context

This platform is developed as an academic project to demonstrate workflow orchestration, system integration, and automation in software engineering environments.
